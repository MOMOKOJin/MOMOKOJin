    "before design the Tron game , classify the object fisrtly :\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1 boarder :\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1 it made of a matrix of square ，the size of boarder is custimized , by input number from player .\n",
    "The default value of unit in matrix is 0, when the position occuppied by player , it will turn into other value .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 Class boarder : \n",
    "\n",
    "create a class, named boarder with initial character of size .\n",
    "and create a method ,when input a number(n), returns a matrix with size of n*n .\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 player:\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 player :\n",
    "\n",
    "it is a double-player game , so two players should have different value after taking actions ;\n",
    "The initial position of two player: A & B are [0][0],and [n-1][n-1] of the boarder ;\n",
    "for player A , I use 'awsd' ,reprents 4 directions , when one unit occupied by A ，the value of unit turns to 1 ；\n",
    "for player B , I use 'jikl' ,reprents 4 directions , when one unit occupied by B ，the value of unit turns to 2 ；\n",
    "ps : define 'awsd'/'jikl' as functional word \n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 Class player :\n",
    "initial character with : name(ID), position ,color , action direction \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To have a better effect ,I set different color font to record two player's action ;\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3 method-making , I created 2 methods :\n",
    "\n",
    "the first one :accum() is to tranfer a move_position(from 4 directions) ,to the accumulated positon on the board , which to gaive value , to calculate all the units player have occupied.\n",
    "the second : game over() used when game is over , with some print sentences .\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4 the rule making --the most crucial part \n",
    "\n",
    "4.1 summary of rule：\n",
    "two players take actions in turns , both of them can move 1 unit per turn , both of player are limited to go new unit which is not occupied , and go out of the boarder is not permitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.2 about action turns ：\n",
    "through while circulation + if else ,for player A take actions every odd turns ,and  B take actions every odd turns;\n",
    "\n",
    "4.3 two symbols for game over :\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. go to the unit value != 0;\n",
    "    2. the 2 positions of unit is not in [0,n-1],which means player go out of the range .\n",
    "\n",
    "4.4 frequency & implement of judgement :\n",
    "\n",
    "system judge the action after every action ;\n",
    "\n",
    "there are 3 conditions whether the action is illegal(error) from steps below :\n",
    "\n",
    "a : whether player input a functional word ? (write it in the class method)\n",
    "    -- if false , player will get a second chance(one more chance) \n",
    "    b : whether the move is go-back or go-after-another player ?\n",
    "        -- if true , game over , and define current play lose the game ,game over \n",
    "        c : whether player go out of the boarder ?\n",
    "            -- if yes , lose the game ,game over \n",
    "when illegal action with a ,seen as error action , trigger a next chance \n",
    "when illegal action with b,c, it triggers the game over , and we judge the player in current turn lose the game .\n",
    "            \n",
    "--if the move action is legal ,turns to the next player \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The advantages of my code-design :\n",
    "1 customization : to increase the involvement of players , set some customized part,like setting a personal username , the size of the board , which means users can adjust the difficulty according to personal conditions ;\n",
    "2 error-tolerance , set if...else conditional statement for the errors below   :\n",
    "• Move that is not listed as one of the 4 directions. \n",
    "• Repeated player ID/colour. \n",
    "• A negative value of the initial location of a player\n",

    "1 : move simultaneously\n",
    "based on the original code, we can remove the Outermost condition judgment , and after that,two players will finish one-step-action in one game turn , to allow players to move simultaneously.\n",
    "ps: the computer player's action is based on player B ,with 4 direction by 'jikl' ,and I set one dictionary connect 4 words with 1,2,3,4 ,then I create one lambda with a randint(1,4), every turn it will create one random number form 1 to 4 , and with each number with one corresponding direction , which is the move_position of computer player but because of the random of the number ,at beginning step there are 50% possibility to trigger the game over condition ,so it is a little  stupid . There are much room for improvement. \\ \n",
